Hello, here in this repository there is a source code in C that allows to generate N non deterministic passwords using well known libraries (stdlib,time,string,...) merging lower,upper,characters, numbers and special characters.

The passwords generated by the source code have been trained in some of the most popular password strength tests such as Kaspersky, PasswordMonster and NordPass, receiving an estimated time to crack of millions and billions of years.

At the moment the default password length is set at 20 characters, but of course it could be higher to raise the security level.


Of course, this is not the final algorithm for generating random password, so I don't take any responsibility if the password generated by this tool could be cracked, this is just a little scientific program.
